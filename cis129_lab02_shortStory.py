print('The Cactus King did not have many nightmares, but tonight would prove to be different')
print('He layed his head down and quickly drifted off to sleep in his dirt bed after a hard day's work of ruling over the cacti')
print('The Cactus King walked up to the castle gates as usual, but the guards did not open the gates or even bow to him')
print('Suddenly, the guards and civilians outside the gate pointed at the Cactus King and shouted "PRICK, PRICK, PRICK" in unison)
print('The Cactus King woke up from his slumber and decided he would do better at showing his appreciation for everyone he ruled over')
